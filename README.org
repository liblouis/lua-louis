#+TITLE: Experimental Lua bindings for liblouis

These bindings allow you to use Liblouis from within Lua.

The bindings are compiled against any lua (between 5.1 and 5.4) that
is found on your system.

Currently they are highly experimental, pull requests are welcome.

* Requirements
- liblouis :: needs to be installed. The bindings adapt to the size of
              ~widechar~.
- lua :: needs to be installed. Any version between 5.1 and 5.4 will do.

* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
local louis = require "liblua-louis"

print(louis.translateString("de-ch-g2.ctb", "Guten Tag"))
#+END_SRC

* Todo
  See [[https://github.com/liblouis/lua-louis/issues][the issue list]]. Mostly the bindings should be more complete and
  idiomatic. Pull request are certainly very welcome.

* License
The bindings are released under [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html][LGPLv3+]].
